# CS160_HYJJR
Final Project of Group HYJJR (Group I) in CS160 Summer 2015

*I. Introduction*
Safe Radius aims to help people alleviate stress when traveling with young children. 
After placing your smartwatch on your child's wrist, you can be notified when they leave a preset safe radius, communicate with them through messages, and find their location on a map. You can also customize the homepage of the app by adding a picture of yourself that will show up on the child's watch notification when they receive a message or set a background photo for personalization purposes. 

*II. System Requirement*
Safe Radius intends to work on a watch with builtin GPS hardware. However, because the Moto360, which is used in CS160, does not have GPS capabilities, we give the watch the GPS capabilities by pairing it with a hidden phone. We assume the hidden phone always stay with the watch and the watch and phone stay with the child. We need another unhidden phone
