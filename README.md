# CS160_HYJJR
Final Project of Group HYJJR (Group I) in CS160 Summer 2015

Safe Radius aims to help people alleviate stress when traveling with young children. 
After placing your smartwatch on your child's wrist, you can be notified when they leave a preset safe radius, communicate with them through messages, and find their location on a map. You can also customize the homepage of the app by adding a picture of yourself that will show up on the child's watch notification when they receive a message or set a background photo for personalization purposes.
